                      STRUGGLE IS REAL


“Sometimes, you face difficulties not because you’re doing something wrong, but because you’re doing something right.”


“No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.


“Whenever you find yourself doubting how far you can go, just remember how far you have come.


“Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength.”
