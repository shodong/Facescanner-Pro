---------------------MOTIVATION OF THE THE DAY-------------------


                        ---HARDWORK---
SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE ARE NOT GIFTED, THEY JUST WORK HARD, THEN SUCCEED
ON PURPOSE.

                        ---CONSISTENCY---
YOU CANNOT BE A WINNER WITHOUT MATURITY AND CONSISTENCY.
 
                        ---PERSEVERANCE---
A BEND IN THE ROAD IS NOT THE END OF THE ROAD.

                        ---PATIENCE----
PATIENCE IS THE ROAD TO WISDOM.
